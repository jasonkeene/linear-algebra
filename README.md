I'm learning linear algebra and using this repo to document my work towards
that result. I have experience with linear algebra through high school math
and certain college math classes that required its use but I have not studied
the subject in a dedicated way until now.

I will be reading Gilbert Strang's textbook and working through all the
examples and problem sets. I will also be working through the OCW course
material for 18.06SC and generally pulling in learning materials from multiple
sources.

I also plan to implement the computational parts using Jupyter notebooks and
use this as an excuse to learn matpotlib, seaborn, numpy, scipy, and the rest
of the Python data ecosystem.

## Running Notebook Code

To easily spin up Jupyter lab with all the dependencies needed you just need
to have Docker installed and run `make up`. Once the server starts it will
output a localhost link with a token you will need to click to launch Jupyter
lab.
