I'm reading Gilbert Strang's textbook on linear algebra and using this repo to
record some of my experiments with problems in Jupyter notebooks. This is
mostly an excuse for me to learn matpotlib, seaborn, numpy, scipy, etc but
also to just better understand the linear algebra problems outside of the
bounds of manual graphing/imagination.

To easily spin up Jupyter lab with all the dependencies needed just run `make
up`. Once the server starts it will output a localhost link with a token you
will need to click to launch Jupyter lab.
